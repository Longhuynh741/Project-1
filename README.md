# Toned Tribe

This application is designed to provide users with interactive maps of gyms and health food markets. Any user wanting to connect to the health and fitness community nearby can use this application as a compass, showing them what is nearby relevant to said community.

## Navigating the Website

At the end of the carousel of pictures, a button can be found that will bring the user to the search bar further down on the page.

The user is then presented with two buttons, "Find Gyms" and "Find Markets". Upon entering their city and state into the search bar, the user simply selects which of gyms and markets they want to appear on the map.

The user is then brought to the map page, where an interactive map will be generated when the page loads. Above the map, an inspirational quote will generate to inspire wisdom and willpower to encourage them in their health and fitness journey.

If the user wants to navigate back to the home page to search for the other choice, a home button can be found below the map.
